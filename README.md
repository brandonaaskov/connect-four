# Connect Four
This is a basic Connect Four game. The code can get complex quickly, but that's what tests are for :) 

Sometimes you have to dive into a project early on and catch up, and no better way to hit the ground running than to take on some issues and open a PR or two. There are two issues in the project already. Do your best to tackle them, and open a separate pull request for each. Ideally the pull requests will also include tests for the added functionality.

## MobX
This project is setup with MobX and decorators. MobX is a state management solution, and is often pitched as "redux without the boilerplate", but it's so much more; it's great and easy to pick up. Decorators go a long way torward making it so easy, but they might look strange if you've never seen them. Their [documentation](https://mobx.js.org/index.html) is great, as is [their getting started guide](https://mobx.js.org/getting-started.html), plus we're just using the basics here.

## Refactoring
Refactoring is a normal (and healthy) part of software development. For the two issues created, try to _not_ refactor too much. If you see opportunities to refactor and it's just itching your brain, please open a pull request for that. Please note this is _completely_ optional.

## Spacing
It seems [Jon](https://github.com/notjonmadden) likes 4 spaces instead of 2 and I'm gonna be honest... it feels so wrong to [me](https://github.com/brandonaaskov). But that's not why we're here, so let's just let it slide.
